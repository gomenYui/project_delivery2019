This is the Professional Portfolio for university PIndependent Games project : Spatium in 2019 T3 by team IGS2

### By Frank C

Our teamâ€™s project is to make a 3D Open World game call SPATIUM. SPATIUM is an open-world, sandbox style game to be developed in Unreal Engine 4, this project started from University trimester 1 2019. SPATIUM is a science-fiction game in which players must seek a new planet for humankind as Earth is no longer habitable. Player can control of the two main characters, Tarik and Wang Shu. Follow the story line and the quests, player require to fly the first colonising ship through the galaxy, land on the planet (Domum), interact with alien beings ,and establish a colony; one of the main objectives is gather resources to maintain the colony. 

Currently the aim of SPATIUM game project is become a platform for students to complete project unit. There has no long-term plan now to release the game outside of the university project unit now, but the game could be molded into something beyond a student project and maybe release to public, if everything goes well.

As the game development progress, the project contains different roles for team members. The roles in our squad are: Unreal Engine Developer, Concept and Graphic Artist, 3D Model Creation, Audio design / implementation and system / level designer. Also, to complete the actual project work, the squad was broken up into few small working teams, such as NPC AI design team and UI design and implementation team. Each dealing with a different area of the project. 

As a UI/ UX designer and Graphic Artist, I mainly focus on concept and layout design, create art assets and resources, investigate the user experience and design the interaction, create actual user interface and work together with other team members to bring those assets and resources to the game stage. Other than that, I also work on graphic design such as design the promotion materials, logos and illustrations. 

More details are:
Create art assets and resources: In this trimester, I create three new user interfaces, which are Main menu, Instruction Screen and Quest page. All those UI come with assets and resources packages, including different animations and effects, design documents and Photoshop original files as well.

Investigate the user experience and design the interaction: by doing lots of researches and compare with some popular modern computer games, I got some new ideas about interaction and apply in game. I did read some design guideline and documents about why user interface is one of most important area for a game and how to improve user experience. I also did a survey and collected the ideas and answers from my friends and team members about my current design and found out what can do better.

Create actual user interface and import to Unreal Engine: after I created the art assets and resources, I started to work and redesign the layout in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, to make sure the final products will look the same in the game. Before I finalize the design and send to my teammates, I tested the animation and effects in my local library and check can they work the same way in Unreal Engine. After team leader approved and Unreal Engine Developer import resources to the actual game project, I tested the UI and other design together with other team members to check they work normally, and all functions and logics are correcting. 

Graphic design: Based on project requirements and guidelines, we created some promotion materials for the game, such as poster, promotion video and user manual. Like the real in-market games, the promotion materials can help new customer to see the game type and background clear in the first look. My contribution for this part is created the developer logo (squad logo), design and draw the game promotional materials such as poster and flyer, and work with other team members to prepare slides and promotion video for game presentation and introduction. Other than that, I also edited and worked on illustrations for the game start page, main page and promotional materials.
